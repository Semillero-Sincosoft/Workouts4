          <p>Welcome to Angular!</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This tutorial introduces you to the essentials of Angular by walking
            you through building an e-commerce site with a catalog, shopping
            cart, and check-out form.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To help you get started right away, this tutorial uses a ready-made
            application that you can examine and modify interactively on
            Stackblitzâ€”without having to set up a local work environment.
            StackBlitz is a browser-based development environment where you can
            create, save, and share projects using a variety of technologies.

            Components are the main building block for Angular applications.
            Each component consists of:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>An HTML template that declares what renders on the page</li>
            <li>
              A Typescript class that defines behavior A CSS selector that
              defines how the component is used in a template
            </li>
            <li>Optionally, CSS styles applied to the template</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            Although the Angular CLI is the easiest way to create an Angular
            component, you can also create a component manually. This section
            describes how to create the core component file within an existing
            Angular project.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>To create a new component manually:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Navigate to your Angular project directory.</li>
            <li>Create a new file, &lt;component-name&gt;.component.ts.</li>
            <li>
              At the top of the file, add the following import statement.
              <br />
              <code>
                <br />
                import { Component } from '@angular/core';
              </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              After the import statement, add a @Component decorator.
              <br />
              <code>
                <br />
                @Component({
                <br />
                })
              </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose a CSS selector for the component.
              <br />
              <code>
                <br />
                @Component({ <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;selector: 'app-component-overview', <br />
                })
              </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Define the HTML template that the component uses to display
              information. In most cases, this template is a separate HTML file.
              <br />
              <code>
                <br />
                @Component({ <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;selector: 'app-component-overview', <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;templateUrl: './component-overview.component.html',
                <br />
                })
              </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Select the styles for the component's template. In most cases, you
              define the styles for your component's template in a separate
              file.
              <br />
              <code>
                <br />
                @Component({ <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;selector: 'app-component-overview', <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;templateUrl: './component-overview.component.html',
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;styleUrls: ['./component-overview.component.css']
                <br />
                })
              </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Add a class statement that includes the code for the component.
              <br />
              <code>
                <br />
                export class ComponentOverviewComponent { <br />
                <br />
                }
              </code>
            </li>
          </ol>

            In a single-page app, you change what the user sees by showing or
            hiding portions of the display that correspond to particular
            components, rather than going out to the server to get a new page.
            As users perform application tasks, they need to move between the
            different views that you have defined.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the
            Angular Router. The Router enables navigation by interpreting a
            browser URL as an instruction to change the view.

            This topic describes Angular's built-in protections against common
            web-application vulnerabilities and attacks such as cross-site
            scripting attacks. It doesn't cover application-level security, such
            as authentication and authorization.

            During development, you typically use the
            <code>ng serve</code> command to build, watch, and serve the
            application from local memory, using
            <a
              href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#webpack-dev-server"
              target="_blank"
              >webpack-dev-server </a
            >. When you are ready to deploy, however, you must use the
            <code>ng build</code>
            command to build the app and deploy the build artifacts elsewhere.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Both <code>ng build</code> and <code>ng serve</code> clear the
            output folder before they build the project, but only the ng build
            command writes the generated build artifacts to the output folder.

            This Tour of Heroes tutorial shows you how to set up your local
            development environment and develop an app using the Angular CLI
            tool, and provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Angular.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Tour of Heroes app that you build helps a staffing agency manage
            its stable of heroes. The app has many of the features you'd expect
            to find in any data-driven application. The finished app acquires
            and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and
            navigates among different views of heroic data.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You will find references to and expansions of this app domain in
            many of the examples used throughout the Angular documentation, but
            you don't necessarily need to work through this tutorial to
            understand those examples.

            We recognize that you need stability from the Angular framework.
            Stability ensures that reusable components and libraries, tutorials,
            tools, and learned practices don't become obsolete unexpectedly.
            Stability is essential for the ecosystem around Angular to thrive.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We also share with you the desire for Angular to keep evolving. We
            strive to ensure that the foundation on top of which you are
            building is continuously improving and enabling you to stay
            up-to-date with the rest of the web ecosystem and your user needs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This document contains the practices that we follow to provide you
            with a leading-edge app development platform, balanced with
            stability. We strive to ensure that future changes are always
            introduced in a predictable way. We want everyone who depends on
            Angular to know when and how new features are added, and to be
            well-prepared when obsolete ones are removed.

            Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client
            applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in
            TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set
            of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain
            fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks of the Angular
            framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules.
            NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app
            is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root
            module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more
            feature modules.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that
              Angular can choose among and modify according to your program
              logic and data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Components use services, which provide specific functionality not
              directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into
              components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable,
              and efficient.
            </li>
