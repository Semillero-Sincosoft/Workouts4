                    An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.The HTML element is
                    everything from the start tag to the end tag:

                    <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
                    Examples of some HTML elements:

                    In a single-page app, you change what the user sees by showing or
                    hiding portions of the display that correspond to particular
                    components, rather than going out to the server to get a new page.
                    As users perform application tasks, they need to move between the
                    different views that you have defined.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the
                    Angular Router. The Router enables navigation by interpreting a
                    browser URL as an instruction to change the view.

                    This topic describes Angular's built-in protections against common
                    web-application vulnerabilities and attacks such as cross-site
                    scripting attacks. It doesn't cover application-level security, such
                    as authentication and authorization.

                    During development, you typically use the
                    <code>ng serve</code> command to build, watch, and serve the
                    application from local memory, using
                    <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#webpack-dev-server"
                        target="_blank">webpack-dev-server </a>. When you are ready to deploy, however, you must use the
                    <code>ng build</code>
                    command to build the app and deploy the build artifacts elsewhere.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Both <code>ng build</code> and <code>ng serve</code> clear the
                    output folder before they build the project, but only the ng build
                    command writes the generated build artifacts to the output folder.

                    This Tour of Heroes tutorial shows you how to set up your local
                    development environment and develop an app using the Angular CLI
                    tool, and provides an What_Is_HTML5? to the fundamentals of Angular.

                    The Tour of Heroes app that you build helps a staffing agency manage
                    its stable of heroes. The app has many of the features you'd expect
                    to find in any data-driven application. The finished app acquires
                    and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and
                    navigates among different views of heroic data.

                    You will find The_Style_Attributes to and expansions of this app domain in
                    many of the examples used throughout the Angular documentation, but
                    you don't necessarily need to work through this tutorial to
                    understand those examples.

                    We recognize that you need stability from the Angular framework.
                    Stability ensures that reusable components and libraries, The_href_Attribute,
                    tools, and learned practices don't become obsolete unexpectedly.
                    Stability is essential for the ecosystem around Angular to thrive.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We also share with you the desire for Angular to keep evolving. We
                    strive to ensure that the foundation on top of which you are
                    building is continuously improving and enabling you to stay
                    up-to-date with the rest of the web ecosystem and your user needs.

                    This document contains the practices that we follow to provide you
                    with a leading-edge app development platform, balanced with
                    stability. We strive to ensure that future changes are always
                    introduced in a predictable way. We want everyone who depends on
                    Angular to know when and how new features are added, and to be
                    well-prepared when obsolete ones are removed.

                    Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client
                    applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in
                    TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set
                    of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain
                    fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks of the Angular
                    framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules.
                    NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app
                    is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root
                    module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more
                    feature modules.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that
                        Angular can choose among and modify according to your program
                        logic and data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Components use services, which provide specific functionality not
                        directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into
                        components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable,
                        and efficient.
